# Task for gentle-ai-verify

Read-only verify the current working tree implementation of existing OpenSpec change `sprint-1-frontend-core-api-ui-foundation`. Do not edit. Confirm scope boundaries and run/inspect real validations as needed: npm format:check, lint, typecheck, test:run, build; inspect Vite 8085 strict port/proxy, dev-only routing, env privacy, direct fetch restriction, HTTP client behavior/tests, no invented API endpoints/DTOs/handlers/auth scheme while backend/OpenAPI unavailable, and git diff for forbidden areas. Check all requested base component names are actually present and point out missing requirements/tests. Report evidence-backed blockers only, clearly distinguish warnings. ## Skills to load before work
- C:\Users\af156\.copilot\skills\work-unit-commits\SKILL.md
If you make material discoveries, save them to Engram project `upds-judge-front` before returning.

**Output:**
Write your findings to exactly this path: C:\dev\UPDS-JUDGE-FRONT\.pi-subagents\artifacts\outputs\d5ed3511\sprint1-verify.md
This path is authoritative for this run.
Ignore any other output filename or output path mentioned elsewhere, including output destinations in the base agent prompt, system prompt, or task instructions.

## Acceptance Contract
Acceptance level: attested
Completion is not accepted from prose alone. End with a structured acceptance report.

Criteria:
- criterion-1: Return concrete findings with file paths and severity when applicable

Required evidence: review-findings, residual-risks

Finish with a fenced JSON block tagged `acceptance-report` in this shape:
Use empty arrays when no items apply; array fields contain strings unless object entries are shown.
`criteriaSatisfied[].status` must be exactly one of: satisfied, not-satisfied, not-applicable.
`commandsRun[].result` must be exactly one of: passed, failed, not-run.
`manualNotes` and `notes` are optional strings; an empty string means no note and does not satisfy `manual-notes` evidence.
